# Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- An AI coding CLI — [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Gemini CLI, Codex, Qwen Code, OpenCode or GitHub Copilot CLI
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+ and `git` (`npx` ships with Node — the installer refuses to run without them)
- (Optional) Go 1.21+ (for the dashboard TUI)

## Quick Start

### Recommended — one command

```bash
npx @santifer/career-ops init
```

`npx` ships with Node.js — it runs the installer once without installing anything globally. This clones the latest release into `./career-ops` and installs dependencies. Then move into the workspace and open your AI CLI:

```bash
cd career-ops
claude   # or gemini / codex / qwen / opencode
```

**On first launch, career-ops walks you through setup by chatting** — it asks for your CV, your details (name, target roles, salary), and sets up the job scanner with pre-configured companies. Nothing to edit by hand: just answer its questions. Then paste a job offer URL or description and it evaluates it, writes a report, generates a tailored PDF, and tracks it.

### Advanced — clone manually

<details>
<summary>Prefer to clone the repo yourself?</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/santifer/career-ops.git
cd career-ops
npm install
```

Then open your AI CLI in the folder — the same first-run onboarding applies. Use this path if you want to track a specific branch, contribute, or audit the code before installing dependencies.

### PDF rendering (one-time)

PDFs are rendered with a headless Chromium. Install it once per machine:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Available Commands

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Evaluate an offer | Paste a URL or JD text |
| Search for offers | `/career-ops scan` |
| Process pending URLs | `/career-ops pipeline` |
| Generate a PDF | `/career-ops pdf` |
| Batch evaluate | `/career-ops batch` |
| Check tracker status | `/career-ops tracker` |
| Fill application form | `/career-ops apply` |

## Verify Setup

```bash
node cv-sync-check.mjs      # Check configuration
node verify-pipeline.mjs     # Check pipeline integrity
```

## Build Dashboard (Optional)

```bash
cd dashboard
go build -o career-dashboard .
./career-dashboard --path ..  # Opens TUI pipeline viewer
```
